# Docker-compose Quick Setups

This repository contains a collection of quick and easy-to-use Docker Compose setups for various applications and services. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services, and then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the setups in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the Desired Setup**: Each setup is contained in its own directory within this repository. Navigate to the directory of the setup you wish to use.
3. **Review the `docker-compose.yml` File**: Before running any setup, review the `docker-compose.yml` file to understand the services being set up and any environment variables or configurations that might need to be adjusted for your environment.
4. **Run Docker Compose**: With Docker installed on your machine, run the following command in the directory of the setup you're using:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This command will start the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in detached mode.
